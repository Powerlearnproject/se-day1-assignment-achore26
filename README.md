#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to the design, development, operation, and maintenance of software. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Agile Methodologies (Early 2000s-Present): The Agile Manifesto and subsequent frameworks like Scrum and Kanban revolutionized software development by emphasizing iterative development, collaboration, and responsiveness to change.
The Software Crisis (Late 1960s-Early 1970s): This period highlighted the inadequacy of ad-hoc coding practices in managing large-scale software projects.
Object-Oriented Paradigm (1980s-1990s): The adoption of object-oriented programming (OOP) significantly improved code reusability, modularity, and maintainability.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Reuirement gathering - it involves collecting requirements especially from the end users and stakeholders of the software being developed.
Design- Involves high level representation of the software that is being built. eg wireframes etc.
Implementation: In this phase software coding is done
Testing: Once the software has been developed, it is tested to verify if it matches the requirements and goals that it was supposed to accomplish
Deployment:iN THIS PHASE THE SOFTWARE IS RELEASED FOR USE 
Maintenance: Incase there are any errors or improvements that can be done ion the software. They are done in this phase.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Wterfall methodologies follows the sdlc one phase after another but for Agile, each step undergoes iteration in terms of verifying and changing any thing that might not have been thought of or included. Waterfall would be good in implementing a small project where the requirements are known while agile is used in larger projects where requirements are abit more vague and whole idea is unclear.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Develops and maintains software code, implements features, and performs code reviews.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Designs and executes test plans, identifies and documents defects, and ensures software quality.
Project Manager: Plans and manages project timelines, resources, and budgets, facilitates communication, and mitigates risks.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs: Provide comprehensive tools for software development, including code editors, debuggers, and build automation. Examples: Eclipse, Visual Studio, IntelliJ IDEA.
VCS: Manage changes to source code, facilitate collaboration, and enable version tracking. Examples: Git, Subversion, Mercurial.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Requirements Volatility: Employ agile practices, conduct thorough requirements elicitation, and maintain clear communication with stakeholders.
Technical Debt: Implement code refactoring, enforce coding standards, and prioritize technical debt reduction.
Communication Gaps: Utilize collaboration tools, conduct regular meetings, and establish clear communication channels.
Software Defects: Implement robust testing strategies, conduct code reviews, and employ static analysis tools.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Tests individual components or units of code in isolation.
Integration Testing: Tests the interactions between different components or modules.
System Testing: Tests the entire software system as a whole to ensure it meets the specified requirements.
Acceptance Testing: Tests the software from the end-user's perspective to validate its usability and functionality.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering involves designing effective prompts to elicit desired responses from AI models. It is crucial for optimizing AI performance and ensuring accurate and relevant outputs.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: "Generate text."
Improved Prompt: "Generate a 500-word persuasive essay arguing for the implementation of renewable energy policies, citing specific environmental and economic benefits."
